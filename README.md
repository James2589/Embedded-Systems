# Embedded-Systems
TI Simplelink CC3220S Basic Thermostat application

#Project Summary
In this project I used the GPIO interrupt application from TI to create a Thermostat using the TI CC3220S-LAUNCHXL board. In this project I used a task scheduler to check the period for button presses, temperature changes, and display times then take the correct actions based on the inputs recieved.

#What did You do particularly well.
I think I did well at researching the problems to find a proper solution. This was a fairly short class with a lot of information to cover so my biggest takeaway was simply learning how to work through the documentation to find a way to get the behavior I was looking for. I became familiar with embedded systems but really I learned how to learn about these systems and I think I improved at this throughout the course and was able to excel at the project due to this.

#Where could you improve.
I think my biggest weakness here was simply not being familiar with embedded systems and how to work with them. I think this was something that I improved upon throughout the course but still have a long way to go with. I would like to continue working with these types of systems in the future and this will eliminate this particular weakness. 

#What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
This project was probably the first time I had to really dig into documentation prior to this a quick google search would give me the information I needed however on this project I didn't simply need a coding concept and so this became far more difficult as the solution was more specific to the board being used and not just a general solution like many other coding projects I have done up to this point. This meant really diving into the documentation provided by the manufacturer, which took some getting used to but once figured out I found this preferable to just using google because while searching for my specific problem I was catching little bits of information here and there that would later become useful saving me a lot of time in the end.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
My biggest takeaway from this project really comes down to how to find information and this is something that will be usefull in any setting whether a proffesional to educational environment. 

#How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
For this project I wanted to make sure I found the simpleist solution possible and make sure it is well commented and easy to read. Because of this I am able to go back and make changes to the project to potentially offer up a whole new solution. When I code I want to ensure that my code is easily reusable so that I can implement it easily into other projects in the future saving me a lot of time to focus on finding solutions to newer problems. Ensuring that I can easily understand what I did before is a key piece of this so ensuring that i have well documented code both in the form of diagrams and in-line comments. Another important technique is making each function as small as possible allowing for easy reuse without having to make a ton of changes potentially leading to errors in reuse.
